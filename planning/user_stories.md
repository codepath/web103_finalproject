# User Stories

As you plan, it's tempting to jump straight into thinking in terms of implementation: what cool features you'll build and what technologies you will use to achieve your vision. However, starting out this way narrows your thinking about the design of your app and limit its possibilities. You'll need to get coding eventually, but it's important to remember: technology exists to solve problems for people. The balance between design and implementation will be a give and take. Sometimes you will have to make compromises due to technical and time constraints. However, the implementation should always serve the design, not the other way around.

This guide will give you an overview of one common technique for designing technology that's actually useful: writing user stories. User stories are short, straightforward descriptions of an app's functionality expressed from the perspective of the end user. By focusing on users' needs and experiences, user stories help developers prioritize features, create more user-centered products, and ultimately build technology that truly benefits its users.
