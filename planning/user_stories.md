# User Stories

Reference the Writing User Stories final project guide in the course portal for more information about how to complete each of the sections below.

## Outline User Roles

- Fridge member: a user who wants to manage the food in the fridge
- Fridge manager: a user who creates a fridge and manages the fridge members (fridge manager is also a fridge member)

## Draft User Stories

1. As a member, I want to see what kinds of food are in the fridge, so that I can decide what to cook.
2. As a member, I want to add food and update the count of each food, so that the updated information is shared.
3. As a member, I want to know the expiration dates of each ingredient, so that I can use food before it expires.
4. As a member, I want to mark missing ingredients to buy, so that a member knows what to buy.
5. As a manager, I want to create a fridge, so that I can start tracking food in the fridge.
6. As a manager, I want to invite or remove users from the fridge, so that the fridge info is shared only with the people who need the info.
7. As a member, I want to get a list of items I need to buy, so that I don't need to browse the entire list of food in the fridge.
8. As a manager, I want to delete the fridge, so that unused fridges don't float around.
9. As a member, I want to make the food item invisible when there is no food item anymore, so that the fridge info doesn't get cluttered.
10. As a member, I want to keep the food data even after making the food item invisible, so that I can add the food item from the history list.
11. As a member, I want to completely remove the food data from the database, so that next time I add the food I can quickly register new information.
12. As a member, I want to assign a category to each food item, so that the fridge info is organized by category.
13. As a member, I want to sort food by expiration date, so that I can tell which food I should use first.
