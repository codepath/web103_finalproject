## Outline User Roles

As a traveler, I want to view all scheduled trips so that I can manage, update, or cancel them when needed.

## Draft User Stories

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Include at least at least 10 user stories in this format:]

1. As a user, I want to view a list of all my scheduled trips so that I can easily manage, review, or modify my travel plans.

2. As a user, I want to see detailed information about a specific trip, including dates, descriptions, transportation details, destinations, expenses, and documents, so that I can plan my trip effectively and be well-prepared.

3. As a user, I want to add destinations such as restaurants or places of interest to my trip from a list of options, so that I can customize and enhance my travel itinerary.

4. As a user, I want to invite others to my trip and give them access to modify the itinerary so that we can collaborate on the trip planning and ensure everyone is on the same page.

5. As a user, I want to track and split expenses during the trip so that at the end, I can easily calculate the total cost and notify all participants of their share.

6. As a user, I want to create a new trip by providing the trip details (e.g., name, dates, description) so that I can plan and organize my upcoming travels.

7. As a user, I want to update existing trip details, such as dates, destinations, or expenses, so that I can adjust my plans as necessary.

8. As a user, I want to upload important documents (e.g., tickets, reservations, itineraries) related to my trip so that I can easily access them when needed.

9. As a user, I want to view a summary of all expenses split between participants at the end of the trip so that I know how much I owe or am owed.

10. As a user, I want to accept or decline an invitation to join a trip so that I can choose whether I want to be part of the trip and have access to its details.
