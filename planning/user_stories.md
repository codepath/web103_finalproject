3. As a Customer, I want to create an account, so that I have a record of my past purchases and account history.
4. As a Customer, I want to edit or delete my account, so that I have control over my account and data.
5. As a Customer, I want to save items, so that I may go back another day and purchase those items.
6. As a Customer, I want to leave item reviews, so that I may share my experience with an item.
7. As a Customer, I want to read item reviews and ratings, so that I know what items I may want to purchase.
