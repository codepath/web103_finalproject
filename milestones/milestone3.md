## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We worked collaboratively and formulated a workflow. 

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We are both trying to do our parts while maintaining a good line of communication. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We did not but we are coordinating well and prioritizing tasks that are required; as opposed to stretch features. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The feature: The web app implements the ability to reset the database to its default state in order to create a clean slate and create a consistent UX.
The user story: As a seller, I want to make sure there is authorization and authentication, to protect myself and the user.

We will address these issues if they are not resolved by 11/11/23; which allows us ample time to modify them if need be.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Our goal is to work as a team and rely on the support of each other as we progress through the project.
