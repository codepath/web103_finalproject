## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, creating the project board, milestones, and issues went smoothly.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Our group is a bit behind schedule for coding the features but we can easily catch up.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We finished most tasks but not all of them. In order to complete the remaining tasks, we plan to catch up in the next two days.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

We realized that we need to create another table to store documents related to the trip and connect them to the trips table using a one to many relationship.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Some additional support we may need is styling the pages according to the wireframe designs.
