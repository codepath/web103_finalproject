## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We learned how to use the project feature (Kanban) on GitHub. It help us to visualize our tasks and keep track of the progress. Originally, we planned to use Jira for project management. However, with the project feature, we can directly manage our progress on GitHub, and create pull request upon the task is completed. All the history of development can be tracked.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Because of the midterm and assignments in this week, both of us can't really focus on the sprint this week. Therefore, the progress might be a little bit delayed, but we will do more in the following weeks.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Currently, we haven't see any feature that would be considered "at risk".

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Balancing our final project with other coursework has been challenging, and we feel that additional support would greatly enhance our ability to succeed. Options like structured project time or a deadline extension would provide the flexibility needed to engage deeply with each phase.

Additionally, incorporating project checkpoints or time management guidance could help us monitor our progress effectively, ensuring we meet all requirements with reduced stress.
