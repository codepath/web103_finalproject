## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Learning how to use new features on Github to plan my project

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

I was not sure how broad or narrow I should make my issues

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

I am going to finish the setup of my frontend and backend environment tonight, so yes I will complete my first sprint tonight.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I am considering the marked as sold-out feature at risk because I may just take off an item from the shop if it is sold out instead of marking it as sold out in the catalog.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I may need backend support
