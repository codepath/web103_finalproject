## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 During this unit, our team divided tasks clearly and used efficient communication. We supported each other and quickly solved any challenges that arose. We managed our time well, and our positive team spirit made the work enjoyable. This allowed us to complete our tasks swiftly and without interruptions.]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 We faced a problem when the storyboard on GitHub disappeared. It turned out that one team member got accidentally removed from the project. To fix it, we worked together to figure out what went wrong and added the team member back to the project. We learned to be more careful with project settings in the future.]

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Yes, we completed all our tasks in the sprint plan for this week. If we hadn't finished them, we would have prioritized the remaining tasks based on their importance and dependencies to ensure we meet our project goals.]

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 The login feature, which involves using Passport for OAuth, could be considered "at risk" due to potential complexities. If this remains a challenge, we'll allocate more time for troubleshooting and may seek external assistance or consider alternative authentication methods to ensure the login functionality is implemented effectively.]

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 We'd like a mentor to review our work and provide guidance to ensure everything is on track. Their input will help us make improvements and avoid potential issues. This support is crucial for our project's success.]
