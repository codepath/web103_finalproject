## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We had a good time discussing how to structure our API endpoints to pass data to our frontend and we enjoyed choosing the background for our app.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced on your list?

We faced many challenger. We were facing issues with gathering data from RAWG.io to store in our db. We also faced some challenges while restructuring our database schema.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

These are the userstories that are at risk:<br/>
-As a user, I want to be able to easily view new and upcoming game releases so I can stay up-to-date on what's coming out.<br/>
-As a user, I want the option to subscribe to an email newsletter so I can receive regular updates about new games and content.<br/>

we will not implement the function to subscribe to email newsletter because of lack of time and we will not implement upcoming game releases functionality for the same reason.


### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We need support with Database Relationships.
