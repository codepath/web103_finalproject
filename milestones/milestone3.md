## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Our team started meeting more regularly, which helped us stay aligned and communicate more effectively. This time, we believe we’ve completed the assignment (something we’ve struggled with in the past). We’ve begun assigning tasks and dividing responsibilities, so we're set to start working on the boilerplate and core coding this week.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Midterms and exams delayed our start on this project, creating a time crunch. Moving forward, we’ll need to be meticulous about managing our remaining time and prioritizing which parts of the project to complete.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes, we finished this week’s tasks. To ensure we’re focusing on what matters, we’ll use a prioritization framework, like the RICE scoring model (Reach, Impact, Confidence, and Effort). This approach will help us rate each feature or task by time required, difficulty level, and relevance to our project goals, assigning scores from 1 to 8. We’ll then prioritize the tasks with the highest scores.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Currently, the most “at risk” items are larger, time-intensive features that require more development effort and testing. If these items remain at risk, we’ll adjust our plan by breaking them down into smaller subtasks and working on them incrementally. We’ll also focus on completing core functionalities first and leave stretch goals or non-essential features for later.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

For now, we don’t need additional support, but as we progress, we might benefit from:
Technical guidance on specific coding challenges or implementing certain frameworks.
Peer reviews from other groups or mentors to catch potential issues early.
Time management resources to help with prioritizing as tasks become more complex.
