## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The work for this unit didn't take as long as we thought it would. We were able to understand the instructions well and got through the assignment without running into any big problems.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Some parts of the project were new to us, so it took a little extra time to figure out how to do those things. But once we got the hang of it, we started moving faster.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We haven't finished all the tasks we wanted to yet. The first thing we'll do next is to make sure we can add tutors and students into our system. Then we'll work on the login part.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The login feature is tricky, especially if we try to let people use other accounts to log in. If it stays hard to do, we'll change it so people can only log in with a username and password that they create for our site.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Some advice on good tools for building our project would really help us out.
