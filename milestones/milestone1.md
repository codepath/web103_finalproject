## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?


[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 What went well during this unit was how quickly and swiftly we acted as a team as soon as we found out we were teammates. We developed a clear and innovative concept for our app. We then went on to make user stories, where we successfully created comprehensive user stories that detailed the user's perspective with our app, which made us realize on a deeper level about what a user would want from our application.]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 As a team of just two people, we had a bit of confusion because I had a hackathon commitment. But we talked it out and adjusted our project schedule. We also both had college to deal with, so we made a shared calendar and split our tasks better. Despite the challenges, we learned to manage our time and communicate effectively, and we still got our project done.]

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 As we continue with our final project, we could use extra help in a few areas. It'd be great to get feedback from instructors and mentors to ensure we're on the right track. Also, technical support, access to necessary tools, and help with any technical issues would be beneficial.]
