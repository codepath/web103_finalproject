## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to collaborate effectively as a team once we agreed on the concept of the app. Setting up the GitHub repository and organizing our work went smoothly, and we quickly aligned on the app's name and overall theme. It was exciting to start planning the user experience and the key features of **Growify**.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The biggest challenge we faced was deciding what type of app to build. We explored several ideas before finally choosing the personal development concept with the tree character. Once we had our idea, we struggled a bit with choosing the right features that felt achievable within the project’s timeline and our technical skills. We also found it hard to narrow down our ideas without making the app too complex or advanced.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We might need additional support when it comes to implementing more advanced features. Some of the ideas we have, like the streaks and tree evolution system, feel a bit ambitious. We’re concerned about how realistic these features are with the time and resources we have, so we may need guidance on how to simplify or break down these features into manageable parts.
