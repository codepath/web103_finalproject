## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, our team was successful in several areas. We effectively brainstormed and agreed upon an app concept that is both exciting and feasible - a community platform for new coders. We clearly defined our app's purpose and drew inspiration from notable platforms like Codecademy, GitHub, and CodePath, ensuring our app would have practical relevance and a solid user base. We listed the features we aim to include, giving a clear direction for the app's development. We were able to break down the user interactions with our app into detailed user stories, ensuring that we're focusing on user-centric design from the start. This approach is guiding us in the right direction for the next phases of the project.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge we faced was determining the scope of our project. With so many potential features and user stories, it was challenging to decide which elements were essential for our MVP (Minimum Viable Product). This scope definition was critical to ensure that our project is manageable within the given timeframe and with our skill set.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Moving forward, we might need more mentorship in performance optimization. As our platform is expected to handle a number of user interactions and data, strategies for optimizing load times and ensuring a smooth, responsive user experience are important. Insight into best practices for code optimization and efficient database queries would significantly help our project's robustness and user satisfaction.
