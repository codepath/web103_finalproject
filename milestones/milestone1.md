## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Our team worked really well together during this unit to come up with an exciting web app concept - a game discovery app for gamers. We took inspiration from successful existing platforms like Rawg.io to make sure our app would fill a real need and have an engaged user base.

By brainstorming the app purpose and core features as a team, we were able to get aligned on the direction for this project. We clearly outlined the goals and user experiences we want our app to provide. Breaking these down into detailed user stories gave us a solid framework to build off of as we move into the next development stages.

We believe that the strategic planning and user-centric design principles we focused on this unit have set us up for success. Moving forward, we want to maintain this momentum of working together to bring an innovative web app from concept to reality.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We learned the importance of prioritizing core features and intentionally defining an MVP to make the project achievable within our timeline and skills. This discussion brought valuable collaboration as we aligned on the most essential user stories and functionality

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

 We need support on how to improve website performance and responsiveness. We could use some guidance on best practices for modeling these relationships in our database and setting them up in our backend. We have questions around:
 1. How to properly structure the tables and foreign keys to define one-to-many relationships in our schema?
 2. What is the ideal way to implement joins and junction tables to enable many-to-many connections between certain data types in our app?
 3. What are some pitfalls to avoid when designing and querying these types of relationships on the backend?
