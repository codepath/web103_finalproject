## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

What went well during this unit is that we successfully completed the planning phase by defining clear user roles, writing detailed user stories, and listing all the core features of the project. We also agreed on a unified vision for the project, which helped ensure alignment within the group. The collaborative brainstorming sessions allowed us to finalize these deliverables efficiently.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Some challenges we faced included narrowing down the user roles to keep them focused and relevant. Additionally, writing user stories that were both clear and achievable required multiple iterations. Ensuring that everyone in the group had a shared understanding of the projectâ€™s scope also took some time, as we had to balance feature complexity with feasibility.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

In the upcoming units, it would be helpful to receive feedback on the user stories and feature list to ensure we are on the right track. Support with project planning tools, like setting up a timeline or task board, would also help keep us organized as we move into development. Additionally, guidance on potential technical challenges, such as tool or API selection, would be beneficial as we transition from planning to implementation.
