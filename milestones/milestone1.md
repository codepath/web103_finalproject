## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I've got a grasp of what user roles and user stories are and how to design them. The resources and examples helped me a lot.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

It was a bit challenging to figure out appropriate granularity and comprehensiveness of user roles and user stories. We might need to revise them as we go.

Time management will also be key as we are juggling school work as well.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Task management tools might come in handy.
