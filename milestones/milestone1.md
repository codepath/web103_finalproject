## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We came up with the project idea smoothly, and we scheduled the meeting time well. All of us had a great time during the discussion and collaboration.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We spent a bunch of time deciding which features we should include in our project, so that the project is doable but with some sort of complexity.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We would need to learn ways to authenticate users when they sign in to our webpage, and we hope that CodePath can provide us some tutorial or guidance of how to do this. We also what to improve our documentations that we wrote, so we would also want the TF and the Instructors to look over our work.
