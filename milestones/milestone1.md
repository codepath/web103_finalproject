## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

All team members have successfully completed the app planning and incorporated the features into capstone project proposedly. A mutual agreement has been established and members have a solid understanding of the base MVP, requirements, and a realistic timeline for each milestone.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Choosing and planning a solid, user-friendly project was quite challenging. However, with some research and member feedback, we came up with a project that meets all the requirements and expectations. This will be a fantastic learning opportunity for members to collaborate and participate in a team-like environment.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Not all members are fluent and proficient in the technologies selected, but some compromises had to be made. We will take time to learn and practice with each tool to again proficiency. Assitance from tech fellows and office hours will be crucial throughout the development for the successful capstone project.
