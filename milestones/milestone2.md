## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Despite the challenges we faced, there were several aspects of this unit that went particularly well. Most notably, our team showed strong communication and collaboration, making the best of the time we could coordinate. Everyone was proactive in sharing ideas and responsibilities, which allowed us to make steady progress even when we could not all meet together. Additionally, we were able to quickly outline the key components of our entity diagram and wireframes, establishing a clear vision for our project early on. This initial alignment helped us remain focused on our goals and created a strong foundation for the upcoming stages of our work. Our adaptability and shared commitment to the project have made this experience productive and rewarding, setting us up for success as we move forward.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the main challenges our group faced in this unit was finding the time to fully engage in the design process for our project, which included creating an entity diagram, wireframes, and developing a compelling pitch. With each of us juggling multiple courses and other academic commitments, coordinating schedules to work on the project together proved difficult. The time constraint not only impacted our ability to collaborate effectively but also limited our availability for brainstorming sessions, where we could have collectively explored more creative or comprehensive solutions. While we were all motivated to make meaningful progress, balancing these competing priorities required us to be particularly strategic in how we divided tasks and communicated updates, ensuring that each member could contribute effectively despite our busy schedules.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As we continue to work on our final project, additional support in the form of structured time or even a potential extension would be immensely helpful. Given the challenge of balancing this project with other coursework, having dedicated time within our schedules, or a slight extension on deadlines, would allow us to fully commit to each step in the process, from refining our entity diagram to polishing our wireframes and pitch. Such support would enable us to maintain quality in our work without compromising our efforts in other classes.

Perhaps guidance on effective time management or project checkpoints could also support us in tracking our progress, ensuring we can meet each requirement of the project without added stress.
