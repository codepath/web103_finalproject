## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Working on time with each other went really well. We were able to complete the basic wireframes on Monday and worked together until completion. We met again on Friday in order to discuss how to complete how the 3 pages will be visualized, and we were able to finish that quickly and swiftly. We also divided the rest of the tasks equally between us throughout the week to ensure none of us were overwelmed with too much work. ]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾The visualization of the pages became a bit of a challenge for us. We tried to encorporate what other similar sites were like and how we would like to make the site appear. We came up with a color scheme along with this but were not able to implement it into our figma right away, as the color did seem a bit off. We hope to fix this issue as soon as possible while designing the site and have clean, simple UI in the actual website]

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 In the future, it would just be great if our mentor can visit us more often for helping us out with the visualization and the coloring of the webpage. Furthermore, it would be great to discuss the ideas we have come up with her so we can reach a conclusion about what we should finalize in our website]
