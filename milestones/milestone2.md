## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, we successfully created and refined wireframes for the key pages in our app, including the login page, recipe suggestions page, and profile page. We also finalized the entity relationship diagram (ERD) for our database, ensuring all required relationships are represented, such as one-to-many, many-to-many, and one-to-one. The collaborative work on the ERD helped us align on data structure and optimize for our planned functionality. Our team was able to stay on schedule and coordinate effectively, which streamlined the planning process.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

We faced a few challenges, particularly in deciding on the final data model structure. Finding the best way to represent the relationships between users, recipes, and ingredients required several iterations to balance simplicity and functionality. Additionally, we encountered difficulties with the wireframes for certain features like the ingredient input form and recipe details, as we wanted these to be intuitive but also flexible for future scalability.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As we move forward, guidance on implementing authentication securely would also be valuable, as we plan to restrict certain features to logged-in users. Finally, advice on deploying the app on Railway with best practices for database management in a production environment would be beneficial.
