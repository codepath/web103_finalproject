## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[Rob - We communicated our boundaries at the beginning of the week and were able to accomplish everything on time.]
[Zion - Communication was fire once again. We did our own delegated tasks.]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[Rob - I had some challeneges on deciding what to make for the wireframes, but I looked at some examples and was able to get a good idea of what I wanted to design.]
[Zion - Finding the right timezone for us to talk in because we're in different states.]

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[Rob - Since I believe we're moving into the coding phase, I think we'll need some support on how to implement our ideas into code.]
[Zion - Probably coding support since I'm not too versed in web-scraping.]
