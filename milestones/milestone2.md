## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I made clear wireframes that will help me visualize the website going forward.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

I was not sure how to split up the accessories in the database since we have 6 different accessory types. I opted to add them to one table and have a type attribute for simplicity.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I think I will need backend support going forward, but if I work diligently, I should have no issues.
