# Milestone 2

- [x] In `planning/wireframes.md`: add wireframes for at least three pages in our web app
- [x] In `planning/entity_relationship_diagram.md`: add the entity relationship diagram we developed for our database
- [x] Prepare three-minute pitch presentation, to be presented during Unit 7 (the next unit)
- [x] In this document, complete the **Reflection** section below

## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, the development of the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) was a significant achievement. It provided a clear visualization of the database structure, ensuring that all the necessary entities and their relationships were well-defined. This helped in understanding the flow of data and the interactions between different entities, which is crucial for the app's functionality.

Creating the wireframes and later adding those the slide was a learning experience and we got to collaborate more.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One of the challenges faced during this unit was ensuring that the ERD accurately represented all the functionalities and features of the app. With a diverse set of features, from discussion boards to resource sharing and progress tracking, it was essential to capture every detail in the ERD. Another challenge was deciding on the relationships between entities, especially when it came to many-to-many relationships and their representation. Balancing the user experience with the technical constraints was also a point of consideration, ensuring that the app is both user-friendly and technically robust.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

As we move forward with the development, we'll need support in implementing the many-to-many relationships, especially with the join tables. Guidance on best practices for database optimization and ensuring efficient queries will be beneficial.
