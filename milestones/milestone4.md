## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Implement core frontend and backend features like CRUD endpoints and the main database schema.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge we faced was scoping the work properly and taking on too many tasks at once. 

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We did not finish all planned tasks. About 70% of our outlined stories were completed and committed. To prioritize the remaining tasks, I would focus first on finishing the core user stories. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

These are the userstories that are at risk:<br/>
-As a user, I want to be able to easily view new and upcoming game releases so I can stay up-to-date on what's coming out. <br/>
-As a user, I want the option to subscribe to an email newsletter so I can receive regular updates about new games and content.<br/>

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

We need support on implementing Authentication.
