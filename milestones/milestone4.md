## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

What went well during this unit was that we were able to meet up regularly, communicate more effectively, and share the workload. Our collaboration improved, and we were able to work towards the end goal more cohesively.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

A challenge we faced was that we ended up working on the same task at times, which caused some confusion. Moving forward, we plan to share tasks more efficiently and communicate better about who is responsible for what. Additionally, since both of us are stronger in backend development, progress on the frontend has been slower than expected.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes, we finished all of the tasks outlined in our sprint plan for this week. However, we believe there’s room for improvement in our planning process. In future sprints, we will focus on better planning and utilize our strengths more effectively to improve efficiency.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The features and user stories that are “at risk” are the ones we initially planned to work on but haven't had the chance to fully address yet. To mitigate this, we will prioritize these tasks in the coming sprint and focus on delivering them first to avoid further delays.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Currently, we do not foresee needing additional support for the upcoming units. However, we will reach out if challenges arise that we cannot resolve on our own.
