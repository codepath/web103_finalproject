## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 What went well during this project was the team work. We meet very often for standups, and keep in contact everyday to discuss what to do for our project.]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 The main errors that occured were merge conflicts. We are still in the midst of resolving them. ]

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Siobhan was able to finish, while I was unable to. I plan to dedicate more time this week and make a schedule for myself. ]

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 The perks section seems to be at risk due to time constraints, but we will try our best to implement it before it is time for presentations. Our plan is still the same, however, for the rest of our pages.]

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 We will  just need the TF's to check over our work and help us anywhere we have errors.]
