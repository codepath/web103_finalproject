## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We were able to communicate and discuss about our we app, what important feauters we want and how to optimize our features so that we can finish all our baseline features along with the streched features on time. Additionally, we successfuly set up our backend and frontend and were able to complete most of the baseline features.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Although Login/SignUp frontend were set up, we are having challenges to set up the backend for the GitHub authentication for users login and sign up.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We were able to finish 60% of our this weeks target which inclued implementing CRUD features in discussion board, dynamic routes, and database schema optimization. Prioritization of remaining tasks would focus on backend features critical to user interaction, like authentication which is central to the user experience.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Currently, the user authentication is "at risk" due to its complex nature and dependency on both frontend and backend completion. If these remain at risk, we will need to reassess the task distribution, potentially seeking additional support for backend tasks to ensure timely completion.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Given the workload, additional support in the form of backend development resources would be beneficial.
