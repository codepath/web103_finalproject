## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

1. **Authentication System**: Setting up the basic authentication system went smoothly, including user registration, login, and the setup of protected routes.
2. **UI Design**: Successfully designed and implemented the UI across all pages on the front-end, ensuring a cohesive and user-friendly experience.
3. **Backend Endpoints**: Developed all necessary API endpoints aligned with front-end requirements, streamlining data flow and functionality across components.

   Testing each endpoint with Postman confirmed their functionality and reliability. Additionally, having clear, structured endpoint documentation was invaluable for understanding and quickly troubleshooting any issues that arose.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

- **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Aligning data formats and handling edge cases between the front-end and back-end presented some unexpected challenges.
- **UI Consistency**: Ensuring consistent UI design across different devices required extra testing and adjustment.
- **Authentication Edge Cases**: Handling edge cases in authentication, such as session expiration and incorrect credentials, required additional attention and testing to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Most tasks in the sprint plan were completed, but a few remain in progress. The remaining tasks are prioritized as follows:

1. **Finalizing the Authentication Flow** – Ensuring that the user experience is smooth across all edge cases.
2. **Refining UI Components** – Minor adjustments to improve responsiveness and aesthetic consistency.
3. **API Documentation** – Adding final notes and clarifications for easier future reference and collaboration.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The following items are at risk:

- **Advanced Authentication Features** (e.g., two-factor authentication): Additional time may be needed to integrate these features if they remain incomplete.
- **User Profile Customization**: Due to time constraints, certain customizations may need to be postponed until essential functionalities are complete.

If these items remain “at risk,” we will prioritize the core functionalities and schedule these features for the next development cycle.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

1. **Backend Scaling**: Guidance on optimizing the authentication system for scalability as more users are anticipated.
2. **Advanced Security Measures**: Assistance with implementing security best practices to safeguard user data.
3. **UI/UX Refinements**: Access to design feedback or resources to enhance the visual and interactive experience.
