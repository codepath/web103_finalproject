## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

This week our code had no bugs and everything was running smoothly.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

One challenge our group faced was completing tasks from last milestone along with this milestone, it was difficult to catch up.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Not all, I would prioritize getting the main features out first and then work on additional stretch features.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Some feature I would consider "at risk" is having a user log in and log out so that users can be added to trips.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Some additional support required would be for helping one of our teammates on how to create github branches and merge changes.
