## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

During this unit, the most successful aspect was gaining a deep understanding of backend development. I was able to successfully implement various backend functionalities, ensuring that the server, database, and authentication mechanisms worked seamlessly. Additionally, I devoted considerable effort to the frontend, achieving a functional and user-friendly interface. My problem-solving skills were significantly enhanced, as I navigated through complex coding challenges and debugged effectively.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The major challenges were centered around deployment and integration. As I was mostly working on the backend, I faced several issues with getting the application deployed successfully, particularly in aligning the backend and frontend components on the hosting platform. Moreover, helping my partner manage version control with Git presented its own set of hurdles. Ensuring code compatibility and resolving merge conflicts for both of our branches demanded patience and meticulous attention to detail.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

Implementing features like dynamic routing, RESTful API, and a many-to-many database relationship are among the technical accomplishments we are particularly proud of. The project also showcased our ability to apply concepts learned in class to a real-world application, demonstrating significant growth in our coding skills and understanding of web development.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

Since the beginning of this course, my growth in web development has been substantial. I've transitioned from understanding basic concepts to implementing complex functionalities in a real-world application. My problem-solving skills have improved, and my ability to research and learn new technologies independently has become one of my strongest assets. This was my first time learning Express JS. I got to learn for the first time how to create a structure for the projects and how to set up the connection between frontend and backend which I was always curious about. Learning about all the familiar concepts(API, deployment, etc.) in depth and learning how to implement them in my coding was really insightful. The experience has also honed my collaboration and communication skills, crucial for any successful development project.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

Moving forward, my goal is to solidify my understanding of the tech stacks we learned, possibly by retaking this course next semester. I aim to delve deeper into web development, exploring advanced topics and emerging technologies. Practically, I plan to engage in more projects, both personal and collaborative, to refine my skills. Networking with professionals in the field and participating in coding communities will also be a focus, as these experiences are vital for continuous learning and professional growth.
