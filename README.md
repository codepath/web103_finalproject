## About
This is a Web application that hopes to help the next generation of college students have a smooth transition into the corporate world

### Description and Purpose
# Description:
Career Connect is a web application for computer science students. Students will have access to quality resources like mentorship, job opportunities, and career tips.
On login, the user is greeted with a home page which includes a brief description of its application and its features. Two main options will be provided on the home page: Create a post, Find opportunity.
If the user creates a post, it would automatically be sent to the admins for approval. The post will only be posted for public consumption upon approval from the admins.
If the user chooses to find an opportunity, they are met with a vast variety of resources like conferences, internship opportunities, interview prep and mentorships. They can filter the opportunities by company, pay, college classification, role and type of opportunity. There would also be anchor links that lead to these opportunities in the real world.
The app will also enable students to bookmark applications and track their application status

# Purpose: 
The purpose of Career Connect is to provide students and professionals with a platform to connect with one another and share resources related to the industry. It consists of a job board that displays a list of opportunities. The users can request to post opportunities and the admins will verify the opportunities before they are displayed to the users. It also allows users to share resources and chat with one another if they’d like to learn more about a specific role or opportunity. 

### Inspiration

As college students, we were interested in exploring how we can bring together career-related information and organize it for users. We wanted to learn how we can create a job board that allows users to save and bookmark opportunities. We also wanted to explore how to create a chat feature and implement it.
