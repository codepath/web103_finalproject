## About

### Description and Purpose

RoomMateLink is a roommate matching platform designed specifically for students seeking affordable and convenient housing solutions. The app allows users to post and manage room rental listings, enabling landlords (students with available rooms) to connect with potential tenants (other students) in their area.

The main purpose of RoomMateLink is to simplify the process of finding suitable roommates and available rooms through an intuitive and user-friendly platform. By making these connections easier, the app empowers students to navigate their housing options with confidence.

### Inspiration

The inspiration for this app came from our own struggles with finding student housing. Like many others, we faced the challenge of securing a place that fit our budget, was in a good location, and matched our living preferences. Seeing how common this problem was among students, We wanted to create a solution that would make the process easier. By providing a dedicated platform where students can not only post and browse available rooms but also find roommates who share their schedules and lifestyles, this app aims to take the stress out of student housing.
