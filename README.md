## About

### Description and Purpose

Sneak-Peak is a web application designed to cater to sneaker enthusiasts, and newcomers.
It is a web app built with Node.js/Express and PostgresSQL on the backend and React on the frontend.
The purpose of this app is to allow users to be able to manage, share & showcase their shoe collections.

### Inspiration

We were inspired by shoe buying apps like GOAT, which allow users to buy new and vintage shoes.
We wanted to create an app that users can treat as their digital locker room to store & update their collections, upvote other users shoes, and highlight their favorites.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node, Express, PostgresSQL database

## Backend and Frontend Configuration

- Built using an Express backend and a React frontend.
- Dynamic routes implemented for both frontend and backend.
- Hosted and deployed via Railway.

## Backend Features

### Database Relationships in Postgres

- **User & Sneaker**: One-to-many relationship where each user can upload multiple shoes.
- **User & Sneaker**: Many-to-many relationship where many users can upvote/downvote multiple shoes.
- **User & Profile**: One-to-One relationship is established between users and their profiles. Users can customize their profiles to add additional information, enhancing their personalization within the app.
<!-- 2. **User & SneakPeak Comments**: Many-to-many relationship with a join table to facilitate user comments on Sneak-Peak. -->
