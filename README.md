### Description and Purpose

An online sneaker shop is a digital store dedicated to the sale of sneakers and related footwear products. It provides a convenient and accessible platform for customers to access a diverse selection of sneakers, including popular brands and limited-edition releases. The primary purpose of this online shop is to offer a seamless shopping experience, with features such as detailed product information, secure payment options, and personalized recommendations. It caters to sneaker enthusiasts, athletes, and fashion-conscious individuals, fostering a sense of community by providing insights into sneaker culture, trends, and news. Ultimately, the online sneaker shop aims to make shopping for sneakers easy, engaging, and enjoyable for its customers.

### Inspiration
Sneaker World was born out of a deep and abiding passion for sneakers. As lifelong sneaker enthusiasts, we found ourselves constantly scouring the internet and brick-and-mortar stores to feed our obsession. It was during one of those quests for the perfect pair that the idea for Sneaker World came to life. Fueled by the desire to offer fellow sneakerheads a one-of-a-kind experience, we set out to create a platform where sneaker culture meets innovation. We wanted to bring you not only the latest trends but also a community where sneakerheads can come together, share their stories, and celebrate this unique and ever-evolving culture. Our dedication to the sneaker world goes beyond commerce â€“ it's a labor of love. Thank you for joining us on this exciting journey through sneaker culture, fashion, and innovation. We invite you to explore, discover, and be inspired as we continue to fuel our passion and yours.

## Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js

Backend: PostgreSQL, Express.js, Node.js

## Features
  - Sneaker World is programmed using Express and and ReacT and includes dynamic routes.
  - The entire application is deployed using Railway

### 1. Backend

Sneaker World's backend will have at least one of each of the following database relationship in Postgres:
  - A user can select multiple sneakers to add to their cart (one-to-many)
  - Multiple sneakers can be joined with multiple categories such as: casual, running, cross-training, etc. (many-to-many)
Sneaker World implements a well-designed RESTful API that:
  - Responds to GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests in order to allow for cart and orders to be properly deleted.
  - Implements proper naming conventions for routes.
The web app implements the ability to reset the database to its default state in order to create a clean slate and create a consistent UX.
