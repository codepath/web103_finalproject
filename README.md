## About

### Description and Purpose

Learn More 2gether (LM2) is a collaborative platform that enables users to create study groups, schedule learning sessions, and share resources with their peers. Whether for academic purposes or group learning projects, LM2 allows users to organize study topics, set up sessions, and upload files to help groups stay connected and focused. The purpose is to foster a community-driven learning environment where users can support each other’s educational goals.

### Inspiration

The inspiration for LM2 came from the need for organized study groups in academic settings. With students juggling various responsibilities and time constraints, it's essential to have a platform that makes it easy to schedule study sessions, discuss topics, and share resources. We were inspired by the success of peer-to-peer learning models and wanted to provide a tool to make study collaboration more streamlined and accessible.
