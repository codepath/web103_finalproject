## About

### Description and Purpose

The app helps to keep a complete track of a trip including the mode of transport used, places visited, activities done, restaurants on the go with an option to now the expenses at every point, who paid and when the journey ends split between other people in the trip. We can use apis to show the users the estimated time of travel. No bookings can be made, But can be directed to the respective websites for booking and we at our end keep a track when the user chooses an option. A place to store all essential documents required for the travel.

### Inspiration

We were inspired by the in-class lab On The Fly except we would like to extend this project with more detailed features.
