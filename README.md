## About

### Description and Purpose

Growify is a gamified personal development app that helps users build new skills and habits in an engaging, fun way. Users create and customize their own tree, which grows and evolves as they progress on their personal development journey. By maintaining streaks, completing challenges, and achieving milestones, users earn points to unlock new accessories, abilities, and upgrades for their tree. Growify motivates continuous personal growth by encouraging accountability and allowing users to reinvent their skills along the way.

### Inspiration

Growify was inspired by the desire to make personal development more engaging and fun. We wanted to merge the satisfaction of leveling up in a game with the long-term benefits of building good habits and skills. By using a tree as the character that grows with the userâ€™s progress, we aim to create a visual representation of growth that is both rewarding and motivating. Gamified apps have proven to be effective in habit-building, and we wanted to apply that concept to personal development in a way that feels rewarding without being overwhelming.

We also gained inspiration from applications like https://habitica.com/static/home and https://habitica.com/static/home.
