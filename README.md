## About

### Description and Purpose

StayVue is your ultimate travel companion, seamlessly merging the world of accommodations with an exclusive rewards program, connecting you to local businesses for a personalized and unforgettable travel experience. Whether you're a wanderlust-filled traveler or an enthusiastic host, StayVue is combination of exceptional stays and rewards that make travel memories even more rewarding. Travelers can experience unique accommodation experiences, write reviews and share their own experiences and earn points in return. The more you travel, the more you earn. Collect points on each stay, each review, and through a referral program. A user can redeem their earned points for discounts on future bookings, exclusive deals, and gift cards for local businesses. Additionally, users will get personalized recommendation and stay connected to local businesses, which means that the app's mission extends to not only providing awesome travel arrangements but supporting the businesses in which the accomodation is near. Users can communicate with hosts for a seamless booking process and personalized travel guidance, the hosts can show their trust value with verified identities and properties.

### Inspiration

StayVue's mission goes beyond just booking accommodations; it's about enriching travel experience by connecting you to the heart and soul of your destinationâ€”its local businesses. StayVue is a gateway to immersive travel, rewards, and connections with local communities. Airbnb and other accomodations apps are a huge inspiration for this capstone, but extending the mission in this way is a huge factor into creating a culture of giving back to those communities and the folks who live there.
